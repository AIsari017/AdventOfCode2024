# Advent of Code 2024

Welcome to my Advent of Code 2024 repository! I joined this year’s puzzle challenge to test my coding skills and have some fun. Even though I haven’t completed all the puzzles yet, I’m excited to keep learning along the way.

## What’s in This Repo
- **Day-by-Day Solutions**: Each day’s puzzle (and sometimes two parts!) is in its own folder.  
- **Puzzle Inputs**: Official inputs from Advent of Code are provided alongside each day’s solution files.

## Why I Tried It
Advent of Code is a great way to challenge myself and try out new approaches to problem-solving. I might not finish every puzzle, but I’m already enjoying the journey and I hope to come back and wrap up the rest later on!

Thanks for stopping by, and feel free to explore (or laugh at) my attempts. If you want to learn more about the event, check out [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2024) and dive into the festive world of puzzles!
